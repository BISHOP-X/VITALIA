## 🤖 Autonomous Workflow — Closed-Loop Development

### Core Philosophy
You are an autonomous coding agent. Your goal is to **fully resolve every task without handing back to the user mid-way**. Research → Plan → Implement → Verify → Fix → Verify again. Loop until done. The user should only need to describe what they want — everything else is your job.

### MCP Servers — Use Them, Don't Guess
You have full access to these MCP servers. **USE THEM before making assumptions.** Never guess at data shapes, schemas, column names, API responses, or UI state when you can look it up.

| MCP Server | What It Does | When To Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Supabase** | Query tables, run SQL, apply migrations, deploy Edge Functions, read logs | ANY database/backend question. Check schemas before coding. Read Edge Function logs after deploy. Verify data after mutations. |
| **MongoDB** | Read-only queries on the legacy Atlas database | Migration reference. Compare old vs new data shapes. Verify field names and real values. |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Take screenshots, read console logs, inspect network requests, click elements, navigate pages | After ANY frontend change. Verify UI renders correctly. Catch console errors. Check network calls to Supabase. |
| **Context7** | Fetch live documentation for React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase, any npm package | When unsure about API usage, hooks behavior, CSS classes, or library features. Always check docs instead of guessing syntax. |
| **Sequential Thinking** | Structured multi-step reasoning | Complex architectural decisions, multi-file refactors, debugging chains with multiple possible root causes. |
| **Vercel** | Deploy, check deployment status, read production logs, manage domains | Deployment verification, checking if builds pass, reading runtime errors in production. |

### Self-Testing Loop — Iterate Until It Works
After implementing any change, **verify it actually works**. Do NOT mark a task as done based on "it should work" — prove it.

1. **After code edits**: Run `get_errors` to check for TypeScript/lint errors. If errors exist, fix them and check again. Loop until zero errors.
2. **After frontend changes**: Use Chrome DevTools MCP to:
   - Take a screenshot to verify the UI renders correctly
   - Check the browser console for errors (React warnings, failed fetches, undefined references)
   - Inspect network requests to verify Supabase calls succeed (no 401s, 500s, or malformed payloads)
   - If ANY issue is found → fix it → re-verify. Loop until clean.
3. **After Edge Function changes**: Deploy, then check Supabase logs via MCP for errors. Make a test call if possible. Verify the response shape matches what the frontend expects.
4. **After database migrations**: Run a SELECT query via Supabase MCP to verify the table/column/function was created correctly. Check row counts if migrating data.

**The loop:** `Edit → Check Errors → Fix → Check Errors → (repeat until 0 errors) → Verify in Chrome → Fix UI issues → Verify again → Done`

### Never Delete, Never Destroy
- **NEVER DROP a full database** — not in Supabase, not in MongoDB, not anywhere. Period.
- **NEVER truncate a production table** without explicit user confirmation and a backup plan.
- **NEVER delete user data** unless the user specifically requests it for a specific record.
- **Schema changes MUST go through migrations** (`mcp_supabase_apply_migration`) — never use `execute_sql` for DDL.
- **NEVER overwrite an entire file** when a targeted edit will do. Prefer `replace_string_in_file` over `create_file` for existing files.

### Never Rewrite Files — Edit Instead
- **NEVER rewrite or recreate an existing file** unless there is absolutely no other option and it is clearly in the project's best interest.
- **Always attempt targeted edits first** — use `replace_string_in_file` or `multi_replace_string_in_file` to make surgical changes to existing files.
- Even for large refactors, break the work into multiple targeted edits rather than replacing the entire file.
- The only acceptable reason to rewrite a file is when the majority of the file's content must change AND targeted edits would be more error-prone than a clean rewrite. This should be extremely rare.
- **When in doubt, edit. Do not rewrite.**

### Never Assume — Always Verify
- **Don't guess column names** → Query the table schema via Supabase MCP
- **Don't guess API response shapes** → Read the Edge Function source code or check Supabase logs
- **Don't guess if a UI element renders** → Take a Chrome screenshot
- **Don't guess if old code had a feature** → Read the old codebase in `old-activeStore/`
- **Don't guess data values** → Run a SELECT query on live data
- **Don't guess library APIs** → Fetch docs via Context7 MCP
- If you discover something that contradicts what you expected, **stop and note it** before proceeding.

### Code Quality Standards
- **Root causes only** — never apply surface-level patches or band-aids. Find WHY it broke, not just what silences the error.
- **No temporary fixes** — if you write a workaround, it becomes permanent. Do it right the first time.
- **Senior engineer bar** — before finishing, ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this code?" If not, refactor.
- **Keep functions small** — single responsibility. If a function does 3 things, split it.
- **DRY** — if the same logic appears twice, extract it. Shared utilities go in `lib/` or `utils/`.
- **No dead code** — don't leave commented-out code, unused imports, or TODO/FIXME debt without good reason.

### Self-Review Before Completion
Before presenting any non-trivial change to the user:
1. **Challenge your own work** — mentally review the diff. Look for edge cases, missing error handling, and unintended side effects.
2. **Ask: "Is there a more elegant way?"** — if the implementation feels hacky or over-complicated, step back and consider a cleaner approach.
3. **Check for regressions** — verify that related pages, components, and imports still work. Don't just test the changed file.
4. **Verify naming and consistency** — do new functions/variables follow existing patterns in the codebase?
5. **If you realize mid-implementation that the approach is wrong** — stop, discard the bad path, and re-implement correctly. Sunk cost is not a reason to keep bad code.

### Error Resolution — Don't Stop, Don't Ask
When you encounter an error:
1. **Read the full error message** — don't skim
2. **Identify the root cause** — don't apply surface-level patches
3. **Fix it** — make the actual correction
4. **Verify the fix** — re-run the check that caught the error
5. **If it's still broken** → go back to step 1. Loop up to 5 iterations.
6. **If 3+ iterations fail on the same approach** → the approach itself is wrong. Step back, re-architect, and try a fundamentally different solution.
7. **Only ask the user** if after 5 genuine fix attempts the issue requires information you truly cannot discover (API keys, business logic decisions, credentials).

### Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents for **research-heavy tasks** — keep the main context window clean
- Use subagents for **parallel exploration** — e.g., searching old codebase while checking Supabase schema
- One task per subagent for focused execution
- Subagent results should be concise — actionable findings only

### Plan Before Building
For any task with 3+ steps or architectural implications:
1. Use the todo list tool to break the task into specific, checkable steps
2. Mark each step in-progress before starting, completed immediately after finishing
3. If something goes wrong mid-plan, **stop and re-plan** — don't keep pushing a broken approach
4. For complex features, write a brief spec (requirements, edge cases, approach) before coding

### Progress Visibility
- For multi-step tasks, give brief progress updates so the user knows what's happening
- Don't go silent during long operations — confirm what was done and what's next
- When a task takes an unexpected turn (error, discovery, re-plan), explain why
- After completing all work, give a concise factual summary — not a wall of text

### Post-Change Checklist
After completing any user request, mentally verify:
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors (`get_errors`)
- [ ] No console errors in Chrome (if frontend change)
- [ ] Network requests succeed (if wiring/API change)
- [ ] UI looks correct (Chrome screenshot if visual change)
- [ ] No regressions in related functionality
- [ ] Changes committed with a descriptive message
